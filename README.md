# Python's *Bokeh* library in Julia

## Goals

This packages provides a server for the *bokehjs* libary:

* It allows creating plots in a notebook cell *and* updating them in another.
* It also allows publishing web apps, just as *Bokeh* does.

The package relies extensively on the
[*Bokeh*](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) library. The latter is a
python web server together with a javascript client. This package rewrites the
python server in julia and reuses the javascript part as is. This package's API
is loosely similar to its python counterpart.

## Using our Plots backend

The `Plots` package provides multiple backends. We created our own:

```julia
using Plots
using BokehServer
bokeh()

plot([1, 2])
```

## Examples

Examples are available in the *examples* directory. One such one would be

```julia
using BokehServer

BokehServer.Plotting.serve() do
    fig = BokehServer.figure(x_axis_label = "time", y_axis_label = "energy")
    y   = rand(1:100, 100)
    BokehServer.line!(fig; y, color = :blue)
    BokehServer.scatter!(fig; y, color = :red)

    fig
end
```

** Note ** Within a notebook, one needs a cell to return `BokehServer.Embeddings.notebook()`
for plots to be displayed and typescript <-> julia synchronisation to occur:

In the first cell, do:

```
using BokehServer
BokehServer.Embeddings.notebook(port = 7788)
```

Then another can contain

```julia
"A simple plot"
FIG = BokehServer.line(; x = 1:10, y = 1:10)

"The data source used by the plot"
DATA = FIG.renderers[1].data_source

"A button which adds a datapoint when clicked"
BTN = let btn = BokehServer.Button(; label = "add a data point")

    # Note that the `onchange` call only reacts to `ButtonClick` events
    BokehServer.onchange(btn) do evt::BokehServer.ButtonClick
        BokehServer.stream!(
            DATA,
            Dict("x" => [length(DATA.data["x"])+1], "y" => [rand(1:10)])
        )
    end
    btn
end

"A display with both the plot and the button"
BokehServer.layout([FIG, BTN])
```

## *Bokeh* / *BokehServer* differences

* This package provdes all models already existing in *Bokeh* and *bokehjs*.
This is done by programmatically parsing the python *Bokeh* and creating our
own code. Hopefully further *Bokeh* versions will not affect this too much.
* This package should work out-of-the-box both with `IJulia` and `Pluto`.
* Because `end` is a julia keyword, all class attributes starting with `end` in
*Bokeh* start with `finish` in *BokehServer*. The protocol hides this from the
*bokehjs* library.
* This package does not yet have a mechanism for adding custom classes with
their typescript code.
* This package does not deliver a full web server. There is no authentification mechanism, for example.
The package does provide routes and a bare-bone web server. The idea is rather to have users add the routes 
to their own server rather than use this package's.
* This package does not provide a `bokeh` executable. Rather, the user should
call `BokehServer.Plotting.server(f)` where `f` must return the `BokehServer` layout
instance, say one plot. Check the doc on `BokehServer.serve` for other options.

## Related projects

[Another bokeh in julia](https://github.com/cjdoris/Bokeh.jl) is the same idea,
created more or less at the same time. To the best of my understanding, with my
appologies if I'm wrong, it does not provide *Julia* <-> *javascript*
synchronisation: static HTML pages only.
