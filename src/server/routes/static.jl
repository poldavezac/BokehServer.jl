    struct StaticRoute <: iRoute
        roots :: Vector{String}
    end

Provides acces to static files. We find files by iterating through roots and returning
the first successfull path.

Static files can have the following extensions:

* .css: which is a "Content-Type" =>"text/css"
* .gif: which is a "Content-Type" =>"image/gif"
* .ico: which is a "Content-Type" =>"image/x-icon"
* .jpe: which is a "Content-Type" =>"image/jpeg"
* .jpeg: which is a "Content-Type" =>"image/jpeg"
* .jpg: which is a "Content-Type" =>"image/jpeg"
* .js: which is a "Content-Type" =>"text/javascript"
* .pdf: which is a "Content-Type" =>"application/pdf"
* .svg: which is a "Content-Type" =>"image/svg+xml"
* .txt: which is a "Content-Type" =>"text/plain"

with any other extension defaulting to "text/plain".
